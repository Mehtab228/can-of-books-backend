# Project Name

**Author**: Mehtab Riar, Michael Kancov
**Version**: 1.0.0

## Overview

- So far this application connects mongodb database to the backend of our server so we can retrieve data from it. We then connect our backend server to our frontend to retrieve data and display it on page load.

## Getting Started

- The user must make a repo, and then install the dependecies required to make it work using npm install -y. They then have to go on package.json and make sure main and start are using a server.js file

## Architecture

- You need to call all of youre require statements and a new one we added was mongoose. We used node, javascript, express, and dotenv to set up the backend server

## Change Log

10-03-2022 6:00pm - Application now has a fully-functional express server, with a GET route for the location resource.
